## Overview

Bitcoin Revelation v0.3.3 is a stable release that finalizes the wallet, transaction, mempool, mining, API, and P2P networking layers on top of a **frozen Layer-1 Consensus v3**.

This release hard-codes the Genesis block and permanently freezes all consensus rules.  
No chain reset is required and all existing coins remain valid.

A live public seed node is available, allowing anyone to join and mine without manual peer coordination.

✅ No consensus rule changes  
✅ No chain reset required  
✅ Safe upgrade from v0.3.2  
✅ Public P2P network online

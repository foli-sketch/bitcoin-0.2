# Consensus Rules

This document defines the rules by which nodes determine whether a block and a chain are valid.

Consensus is achieved independently by each node through verification of these rules.

---

## Block Validity

A block is considered valid if all of the following conditions are met:

* The block header references the hash of the previous block
* The block height is exactly one greater than the previous block
* The block contains at least one transaction
* The Merkle root matches the transactions included
* The proof-of-work hash satisfies the stated difficulty
* The difficulty value is non-zero

Blocks failing any of these checks are rejected.

---

## Proof-of-Work

Proof-of-work is performed by repeatedly hashing the block header with a changing nonce.

A block is valid only if its hash contains a sufficient number of leading zero bits as defined by the difficulty parameter.

---

## Chain Validity

A chain is valid if:

* All blocks are individually valid
* Blocks are correctly linked in sequence
* The revelation block matches the expected initial state

---

## Chain Selection

When multiple valid chains are observed, the node selects the chain with the greatest accumulated proof-of-work.

If chains have equal work, the first received chain is retained.

---

## Finality

Blocks are considered increasingly irreversible as more blocks are added after them.

Reorganizations may occur but are expected to become less frequent as depth increases.

---

## Summary

Consensus emerges from independent verification.

Nodes do not trust peers.

All validation is local.
